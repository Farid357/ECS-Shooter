# ðŸš€ Migration Guide  
## Migration from version 2022.1 to 2022.2

### Breaking changes
* Minimum Unity version up to 2020.3.* LTS
* Namespaces changed from `Morpeh` to `Scellecs.Morpeh`, `Scellecs.Morpeh.Systems`, `Scellecs.Morpeh.Providers`.
* Globals are separated into a separate package at https://github.com/scellecs/morpeh.globals.
* The `World.UpdateFilters()` method has been renamed to `World.Commit()`.
* The `ComponentsCache<>` class has been renamed to `Stash<>`. All methods for stashes have lost the `Component` prefix, now just `Add, Get, Set, Has, Remove`.
* Filters validate that they do not have duplicate types. For example, `Filter.With<A>().With<A>()` will throw an error.
* Removed `Filter` property from systems, use `World.Filter` instead.

### New API
* Added `ICleanupSystem` suitable for cleanup logic. Called by the most recent in LateUpdate by default.
* The mechanism for cleaning components has been redesigned. Now the component must implement `IDisposable`, and it is necessary to call the `AsDisposable` method of the stesh once in order for the cleanup to take place. For example, the shortest version is `World.GetStash<T>().AsDisposable()`.
* Added `World` method `GetReflectionStash` to get stash not via generic argument, but by `System.Type`.
* Added a `MORPEH_THREAD_SAFETY` define that forces the kernel to validate that all calls come from the same thread the world was created on. The binding to a thread can be changed using the `World.GetThreadId(), World.SetThreadId()` methods.
* Added API for plugins. To use it, you need to implement `IWorldPlugin`.

## Migration from version 2020.* to 2022.1

### Breaking changes  
* Assembly definition and all links have been replaced from `XCrew.Morpeh` to `Scellecs.Morpeh`. Namespace is the same.
* All Globals have lost method `NextFrame`. Use `Publish`, which works exactly as `NextFrame` used to. Current-frame Global events are not supported anymore, they are always deferred. The reason for this change is that most projects used both `Publish` + `NextFrame`, or `NextFrame` only.
* `Entity.ID` is not `int` anymore, but `EntityID` which contains `id` and `gen`. This is a mandatory change for Jobs/Burst support. `World.TryGetEntity(EntityId entityId, out Entity entity)` has been added, which allows checking if entity exists without storing direct reference to it.
* `Filter.Length` is removed completely. It has been replaced with `Filter.GetLengthSlow()` and `Filter.IsEmpty()`. This change is made because recalculating Filter length was quite costly, and most of the time filters length was not needed for developers, making it a useless overhead. It's important to note that most length comparisons were used to check if filter is empty or not, so such checks using `IsEmpty()` are as fast as they used to be, but with a different API. This allowed us to make Morpeh much faster in projects which have a lot of different filters.
* Using `entity.RemoveComponent()` clears components immediately now, and reading ref components data after removing said component is prohibited and will lead to unexpected behaviour.
* Iterating `Filter` does not guarantee any order now. If your logic depended on filters returning entities exactly in specific order, it has to be fixed before upgrading.
* `ComponentsBag` has been completely removed. It has been replaced with `ComponentsCache` which also provides full public access to raw components.

### New API  
* Added new component interfaces `IValidatable`, `IValidatableWithGameObject`. It allows calling default Unity method `OnValidate` for components, f.e. to initialize editor fields. Works only for components added via MonoProvider.
* Added support for native Api (Job/Burst). Details are available in [README](README.md#unity-jobs-and-burst). Most work is done via `AsNative()` for:
  * Archetype (NativeArchetype)
  * ComponentsCache (NativeCache)
  * FastList (NativeFastList)
  * IntFastList (NativeIntFastList)
  * Filter (NativeFilter)
  * IntHashMap (NativeIntHashMap)
  * World (NativeWorld)
* Added `IMorpehLogger` interface and static `MLogger` class. It allows overriding logging behaviour for Morpeh. Console.WriteLine is used for all environments by default, except Unity.
* Added `MORPEH_PROFILING` define. Adding it to Player Settings allows profiling systems without using Deep Profile.
* `Entity.Dispose()` is now public. It allows destroying entities without accessing the World it's in.
* Added viewing multiple worlds in World Browser
